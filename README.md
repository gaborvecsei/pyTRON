# pyTRON

This is a simple local multiplayer TRON clone written in Python

I made the same game in C what you can find [here][4] and it is called *[Consoletron][4]*. I wrote that code at the first semester at my University and unfortunately I used Hungarian words. I had a lot of request (you can see it [here on Reddit][5]) that I should rewrite it with English variable, function names and comments. So I thought I will rewrite it but to spice it up, I will use Python. This is not "just" a game what I made, this is a tutorial for beginner programmers to see, how awesome coding is!

## Controls

| Players     | Moving  |
|-------------|---------|
| Player 1 (x)| W,A,S,D |
| Player 2 (o)| I,J,K,L |

## How to play

The goal of the game is to be the last that collides to the wall, other player or even yourself.

So just try to trick the other and make a trap for the other player!

The rules are simple, so enjoy it! :)
